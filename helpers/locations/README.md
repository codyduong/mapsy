Raw data can take in any format, as long as the final type is in the following format:
```
label: string //Typically intersection name, or other indicator (DO NOT INCLUDE CITY, STATE, ETC).
image: string //Image url
lat: number
lng: number
```

Raw data (or JSON file) should only be used for data that cannot be automatically collected easily (or a method not found)
